# TAPP

TA application, assignment, and matching.

## Contributing

<details>
<summary>If you would like to contribute to the project, we ask that you follow the following conventions.</summary>
<p>

## Travis CI

We use Travis CI for our continuous integration pipeline. As of right now, we have 3 tests that should pass:

```
1. Yarn linting tests for our front end
2. Rubocop linting tests for our back end
3. Frontend unit tests
```
Sometimes Travis CI may fail due to high loads of tasks to finish. In this case, wait until all previous tasks are finished and then push to trigger travis CI again.

### Issues

**Scope**

-   Everything you contribute, no matter how small, should always start with a new issue. The scope of these problems can be quite broad, if necessary, and can be decomposed into collection of smaller issues as the team sees fit. This allows us to be both in documented conversation about what work needs to be done, and to be aware of who has taken on different tasks.

**Structure**

-   The issue title and description should be as descriptive as possible.
-   If you want to take on an issue, assign yourself to it first so that we can track which ones need attending to.
-   We allow two special kinds of issues, proposal and question. Their issue titles should start with [proposal] or [question] respectively, and are meant for issues that require team input.
-   Please label issues as appropriate to the labels that already exist. If you would like to add a new one, open a proposal issue for it.

### Branches

You should **never** push directly to master! Instead, please make a new branch who's name conforms to the following format:

TAPP-[issue number]

i.e. TAPP-1

### Commits

**Scope**

-   An individual commit should always track the smallest unit of work possible, within reason. We want to seperate concerns, as this helps for better debugging, revieweing and log readability.

**Structure**

The general structure should always be:

[change type]([change region]): [short msg][detailed msg]

Where
**[change type]** is one of:

-   feat: A new feature
-   fix: A bug fix
-   ehancement: An improvement on a feature
-   refactor: A code refactor
-   style: A purely stylistic change to the code
-   test: Any change to or addition of tests

**[change region]** is a name of a logical region of code in the project, i.e.

-   docker
-   backend
-   db
-   frontend
-   documentation
-   ... etc

**[short msg]** should not exceed 50 chars

**[detailed msg]** should provide a more detailed message on the next lines.

Example, of two commits:

```
enhancement(frontend): add new view for adding positions

This patch introduces a new front end view for adding positions to the system.
```

```
fix(api): Fix backend endpoint for adding positions

This patch fixes a bug in the API whereby attempts to hit the endpoint meant for
adding a new position would always fail.
```

### Pull Requests

**Scope**

-   The title of PR should either be exactly the issue title, or a rewording
-   Add [WIP] tag to any PRs which are still in progress and not yet ready for review
-   The PR description should mention the associated issue with a hashtag, so that it can be linked
-   All commits meant to resolve an issue must be reviewed by at least one member of the team
-   The reviewer will not merge commits until their changes are addressed, if requests for change apply
-   The reviewee should either rebase their changes onto their commits and push, or push follow up commits addressing reviewer changes
-   The reviewer must be the one to merge the PR after they approve their changes
-   If the PR commits must be rebased, the reviewee is responsible for doing this and should do so in a seperate commit
-   Github's automatic merge commits are acceptable
-   The reviewer must delete the associated branch once the PR is merged (GH provides an option for this)
    </p>

## Getting Started

These instructions will get a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. Currently, the entire app
(using React/Redux, Ruby 2.5.1 and a Postgres database) is dockerized.

### Prerequisties

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (Must be installed seperately on Linux)
3. Ruby, only if you would like to use the precommit hook

_If you are running OSx or Windows, your Docker installation will have come with docker-compose._

### Rubocop and eslint precommit hook

If you want to work on the Rails API, we maintain a script that installs a linter (rubocop) and sets up a
precommit hook making the linter run automatically whenever you commit.

If you would like to install it, invoke:

```
bash ./init.sh
```

### Project Structure

The app is organized into three entities:

-   A rails app, which serves the API
-   A postgress database that the API interacts with directly
-   A React app, which serves as the frontend for the app

### Running the app with Docker

#### Overview

We have four docker compose files that are important to know:

1. `docker-compose.yml` is our base docker-compose file. This by itself will
   build the db and the API
2. `docker-compose.dev.yml` is our development docker-compose file (`docker-compose.override.yml` is
   a symbolic link to this file). This will
   dynamically serve the frontend via a local webpack dev server.
3. `docker-compose.prod.yml` is our production docker-compose file. This will
   also build the db and API, but not the front end
4. `docker-compose.frontend.yml` This will use webpack to build
   the frontend for serving as a static asset.

#### Development Environment First Install

The first time you run docker, you must build the docker images. First, ensure no
docker images are running with

```
docker-compose down
```

Set up the local environment with

```
cp dev.env .env
```

In development mode, the frontend is served via nodejs on port `8000` while the backend/api
is served on a different port. To prevent confusion if you try to access TAPP through the wrong
port, set up a static asset to be served by rails.

```
mkdir backend/public && echo "Please go to localhost:8000 for frontend" > backend/public/index.html
```

Finally, we can build the docker images and migrate the database

```
docker-compose build
docker-compose run backend rake db:setup
docker-compose run backend rake db:migrate
```

Now you can run the project with

```
docker-compose up
```

Access the frontend by navigating to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

#### Development Environment

The development environment can be started with

```
docker-compose up
```

This is equivalent to the command `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up`
or `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
since `docker-compose.override.yml` is a symbolic link to `docker-compose.dev.yml`. On Windows, commands in
this format should be used, since there are no symbolic links.

#### Debugging

To view the STDOUT from a docker container of a running server, you can invoke

`docker-compose logs -tf <image>`

To stop everything, use `docker-compose down`.

To run the ruby console hooked into the current rails session, run

`docker-compose exec backend rails c`

To manually inspect the binary snapshots in the `pg_dump` folder, run

`pg_restore 2020_04_26__01_12_39_tapp_development.psql`

which will display the output to the command line (it won't actually insert into a database.)

#### MailCatcher

To access mailcatcher, visit `localhost:1080`.

You can also access all previous uncleared messages at `localhost:1080/messages`

You can also access the contents of an email givens it's id at `localhost:1080/messages/email.id.source`

##### Running tests from a ram-drive

Since the test suite clears the database several times, it can be slow! To speed things
up by a factor of ~10x, you can run the database from a ram drive instead. In linux, you can
set up your ram drive with

```
cd <tapp home directory>
mkdir /dev/shm/pg_data
sudo mount --bind /dev/shm/pg_data pg_data
```

After this, writes to `pg_data` will happen directly in ram. On OSX, follow the instructions
here: https://superuser.com/questions/456803/create-ram-disk-mount-to-specific-folder-in-osx

After mounting `pg_data` on a ram-drive, you'll have to rerun `db:setup` and `db:migrate`. Data
in the ram-drive (since it's stored outside of docker) will persist after a `docker-compose down`.
However, it will not survive a computer reset.

### Navigating into the containers from the command line

Currently, we define three services under docker-compose: frontend, backend, and
db. If you would like to interact with any of the containers from the command
line, you can do so by invoking:

```
docker-compose exec [service] sh
```

For instance, to interact with the rails app, invoke `docker-compose exec backend sh`.

#### `docker-compose` basics

`docker-compose` is a program that manages docker containers, allowing multiple containers
to be automatically started given a list of dependencies. The basic commands are

```
docker-compose up
```

and

```
docker-compose down
```

which start and stop the images defined in the local `yml` file. Whenever docker starts, it creates
a new copy of the container, and when it is stopped, that container is discarded. That means
there will be no persistent data. The workaround is to tell docker that there are specific folders
in the container that should get passed through to the host's file system (for example, `pg_data`).
That way, when the docker container writes to that folder, changes can be persisted.

There are two ways to run commands in a container with `docker-compose`: `run` and `exec`. A command like

```
docker-compose run frontend npm test
```

will start a new container for the `frontend` service and execute the command `npm test` in that container.
In contrast,

```
docker-compose exec frontend npm test
```

will execute the command `npm test` on an **already running** instance of the `frontend` container. Thus,
if you want to poke around in the internals of an already running container, use `exec`. For most other
purposes, `run` what you want.

### Initializing the Database

To both create and setup your local development database, navigate into the
rails container and run:

```
rake db:setup
```

or from the host environment run

```
docker-compose run backend rake db:setup
```

This will create your local database, run all migrations and populate the DB
with seed data. Note that seed data is loaded from `backend/db/seed/` folder where
each json file represents a table.

Once your DB is setup, you can gain SQL access to it by first navigating into
the DB container, then invoking:

```
$ psql tapp_development tapp
```

## Annotations

We use the annotate gem to automatically annotate our models whenever a migration
to run. If you need to annotate manually, run `bundle exec annotate -p bottom` inside
the docker container.

## Rubocop

As mentioned, we use rubocop for linting and code styling. We have a pre-commit hook
ready that everytime you commit something, rubocop will automatically run on your
staged file to check for styling issues. The configuration is in `.rubocop.yml`
and you can add more (or change) or current styling with configurations found
on the [rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documentation. To
run it manually, just call `rubocop` or `bundle exec rubocop`.

## Unit tests

We use Jest as our frontend testing suite. Our tests are located under `frontend\src\tests`.

Some useful tips or reminders:

- Using `it.skip` can skip specific test cases
- Using `describe.skip` can skip specific test sections
- Never manally edit snapshot files located under `frontend\src\tests\__snapshots__`


## API Documentation

We currently have a Swagger UI locally hosted under the `dist` folder. Within
it is an "index.html" that you can drag to a local browser that will open up
our documentation for our API routes. To make changes, go to the public `gist`
that is pointed to under the `URL` property, and update the existing YAML
there.

OpenAPI 3.0.2 specifications are located
[here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenApi-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).

This online [editor](editor.swagger.io) helps with a live loading of the documentation to write
documentation. Just copy paste the current YAML into the editor to start editing.

## Playbook

### Gemfile.lock synchronization

To keep the Gemfile.lock synced up with what we have on our host machine, run
`docker-compose run <image> bundle install` followed by `docker-compose up --build`.

Example: `docker-compose run tapp bundle install`.

### Migration modifications

If you need to modify a migration file, please do the following within the
docker container:

```
# Undo a specific version number
rake db:down VERSION=####
```

where the #### is the version you want to down from `rake db:migrate:status`.
Modify your database migration file, then run `rake db:migrate`

### Database 'tapp user not created' error

It is sometimes possible that you get a `tapp user not created` issue when
creating the db. To resolve this, remove the `db` folder from the `tmp`
directory, and then re-create everything with `rake db:setup`

If `rake db:setup` fails, invoke `rake db:create` to create a new database from
scratch and `rake db:migrate`.

## Common Issues

1. Docker believes that a server is already running, and fails to run the backend container.

After running `docker-compose up`, you may see a message that reads `A server is already running. Check /app/tmp/pids/server.pid.`. The backend container will fail.

To resolve this issue, halt the docker-compose command (killing the other containers) with cmd-c/ctrl-c, and delete the file located under the project route at `backend/tmp/pids/server.pid`. You will be able to relaunch the server without issues. This issue normally arises when you kill the running instance of the project without alloting time for a proper teardown.

2. Docker cannot start up a front-end service, complaining that it can't find an image.

You can resolve this by using `docker container ls -a`, finding all
deactivated containers, and then removing them with `docker container rm [container ID]`. Then, you should be able to run `./start_local.sh`

3. When RE-installing the dev environment, the database fails to setup.

After running `docker-compose run backend rake db:setup` you may see a message that reads `FATAL: role "root" does not exist` or `FATAL: role "tapp" does not exist`.

To resolve this issue, delete the folder `pg_data` that was created from your previous dev environment installation to allow docker to create this again. Then, you should be able to run `docker-compose run backend rake db:setup`.

4. Travis CI fails to execute a script.

This issue usually comes up when adding a new executable script on travis. Your
build fails because the script is `permission denied`. To resolve this, you
must check in the file with executable permissions.

For example, say `build.sh` is unable to execute. To fix this, you must do:

```
git update-index --add --chmod=+x build.sh
git commit -m "Make build.sh executable"
git push
```

This should resolve the issue
